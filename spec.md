# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application

cli.rb controls the workflow of the gem providing various command line interaction methods.

The available options from within the CLI are:
* Viewing a list of teaser articles
* Choosing an ID from the teaser list which provides output of the full article
* An added bonus at the end of the full article is the option to open the source article in a browser

- [x] Pull data from an external source

Pulling data from https://factcheck.org/fake-new/ to scrape.

- [x] Implement both list and detail views

I created two methods for scraping the data required for this gem:
* The first method <code>search_results</code> parses out the fields required to make up the initial list of article teasers. This required setting an id for each teaser article that is then used to pull up the full article.

* The second method <code>answers(answer_id)</code> scrapes the full article and is associated with the <code>search_results</code> method via the more_link variable.
